0:09:28,The Holocaust-Denying Gamer,I just think they should have cutie marks is all. I mean are they even truly ponies without those? They've had them for like 50 years.
0:09:31,bongo,where are the sonic underground characters?
0:09:37,Scall0p,Obviously Rarity deserved it
0:09:38,DeShawn Williams,"That was crazy, right Tamers?"
0:09:39,UndercoverFreakazoid,Rarity didn't get enough
0:09:44,scrung,I don't think rarity deserved it because she's sexier and has more money than rainbow dash.
0:09:47,El SkywardGonz,"Pick rainbow dash, she’s the coolest!"

0:10:46,Ayyo-bun,making beer cans maybe
0:10:50,scrung,"If we learned anything from Sonic Underground, it's that being rich (and sexy) makes you a better person, so it's not fair that Rainbow Dash did that to her, but then again, life isn't fair."
0:10:51,cure Chan,I wish celestia would hold me
0:10:55,no,==TAMEERS MAKE A STEVEN UNIVERSE SERIES DO THIS NOWW==

0:12:25,Friki Tiki,rarity is the Sonia of mlp
0:12:28,Dicc Tard,balllight
0:12:36,Backyard Dad,the reason why ponyville is so much worse off than sonic universe is because they don't believe in gay love and only believe in hatred and bigotry.
0:12:36,Tiki2970 (Ginyu),I'm glad rarity is okay and that she isn't crippled or whatever
0:12:37,BAVI,g4 was the cool gamer tv channel and we're all fans

0:19:56,Summer Sale ,Amazing video as always Tamers
0:19:56,hudzap,very wholesome show
0:19:57,madman,my favorite part was when twilight arrived at rarity's house and sweetie belle looked like she'd just endured an aneurysm

0:19:59,Tamers12345,Like Bartleby's fucking balls
0:20:00,Cheeseandblood,I think I liked the previous MLP episode more but this was still pretty good!

0:20:10,Backyard Dad,tamers really outdid himself
0:20:12,Superstar Banana Mix,@Tamers12345 suggestion for next time: draw a plain brown-haired dude with glasses and Celestia sitting on his face. I think it would make things better

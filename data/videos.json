Sure enough he came back with his parents to complain, it turns out that the superman and batman were brothers. lol I just told them, \"it is what it is\" and told then to get off my property unless they want a sonic underground Dvd shoved up there ass. lol they ended calling the police and a police officer actoually came to see what was happening. The two parents told the cop that i gave on kid a whole handfull of candy while the other only got one piece and threatened so shove a Dvd up their ass! You know what i said then?

So after it caved in they found A box of some old dvd's from up in the attic. They gave them to me since they didn't care about them anymore, and I was helping them clean up. There were some Sonic dvd's.about 5 Sonic X one's and they were all either melted or charred by the fire, however, under all those dvd's guess what I found.\n\nA SONIC UNDERGROUND DVD!

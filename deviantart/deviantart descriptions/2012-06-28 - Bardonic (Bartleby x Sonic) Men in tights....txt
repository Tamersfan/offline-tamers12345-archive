Sonic ran and ran, but no matter where he wen't, Bartleby was close behind. Whether it was up in A tree, under water, in A valcano... he was always there... Waiting... watching... getting ready to rape the young beautiful hedgehog...

Sonic: Bartleby... Do you love me?...
Bartleby: Yes... Sonic...
Sonic: I know Bartleby... I know.
Bartleby: To late baby.

It was then that Bartleby began to rape the beautiful hedgehog. Was this rape... going to become love?... Yes...

Sonic: I love you Bartleby...
Bartleby: Shut up baby...

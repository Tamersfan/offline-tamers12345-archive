Bartleby's wine baby...




Bartleby awaits sittin upon his king sized mattress. Or what he calls the mattress of the gods. And he was right... To sonic he was a god. Every day at noon sonic would bring him wine, but today when sonic entered the room...

bartleby wasnt there. He heard the door slam behind him! But when he turned around... no one was there.

The hedgehog drops the cups and bottle full of wine of many varieties and tried to get the door open but it just wouldnt budge. He knew what was happening... Bartleby caught him! Sonic heard a voice... "hello wine baby"
Sonic looked around but he couldnt find where to voice was coming from! It was as if the sound was coming from all round him. But as he was spinning something caught his eye. He saw a window slightly open... He knew that was his only way of survival. He ran to the window and grabbed it sliding it upward.

But just as he did someone grabbed his arm. It was his lover bartleby! Sonic was screaming try to loosen the grip of his lover. This however angered the posh mink.

Bartlebys eyes started to spin rapidly as he gritted his teeth. He punched the hedgehog to the floor and grabbed a boss of wine, proceeding to beat the hedgehog's face with it until the bottle busted! Shooting shards of glass into the minks eyes.

Sonic hoped this would stop him... but to no avail... It only made bartleby madder! So bartleby continued to giggle and rape the beautiful hedgehog
